				                    <p>A journey to build trust and help people transact online securely. It's been more than a year since I joined the Identity team with a goal to create a platform for managing all your online identity at one place in a private secure and trustworthy way. We desired to create identity management tools give you the power to share and protect your data exactly the way you want. Controlling your personal information online doesn’t have to be hard. One of imporatant aspect for me has been to not to just define but redefine the problem as time passes and landscape changes.</p>

				                    <p>This is just half part of the story the second half which involves our API and a business platform to help our partners be able to integrate and provide a complete identity verification mechanism and also give users all the control as well as security.</p>

				                    <p>My role is to rally the team around user-centric design. I work across user testing, high-level UX design, UI design, and interactive & motion prototyping. Developed wireframes to support key pages and flows, communicating ideas in a credible manner, leveraging competitive research, conferences, and latest trends. Also, I was responsible for translating the product vision and the experience through diagrams and wireframes.</p>


				                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Problem & Goals</h2>

				                    <p>Okay here is the scenario lets say Fiona is a 28-year-old Finance Associate and she uses Uber to ride to work, prefers to stay in Airbnb when she travels and also orders a lot of stuff via amazon. She has to prove that her identity separately in all these places and more but she doesn’t trust. She wants a portable and reusable digital identity platform which she can trust and securely authorize other services to use. Our findings indicated that people really wish for some sort of a digital passport verified as per government standards which they can use universally but also be able to manage and control their information. People often pointed out how difficult it is to verify themselves in each new services or website especially if it needs you to pull out a real state iD/passport or even providing SSN is not trustworthy.
</p>

				                    <blockquote>Our findings indicated that people really wished for some sort of a digital passport verified as per government standards which they can use universally but also be able to manage and control their information.</blockquote>


				                    <p>A large part of my role is to also do user testing and analyze user feedback, analytics, and data to help the team identify opportunities for improvement in the experience of the product. Created interactive prototypes to simulate proposed functionality to aid in the design and development process. The challenge has always been to simulate the experience in the correct and cheap way to take the most out of the user research exercises.</p>
 <h2 class="section-heading">The Process & Workflow</h2>

				                    <p>The initial research to look at how identity verification experience is designed currently in 3 spheres the Government, Financial institutions and Sharing Economy/Private Sector. We realized there were two sides to this problem, one where the end users felt the pain and wanted a better portable experience with their identity and second where a B2B partnership was needed with the private sector and govt. to educate and also help them integrate the solution. I talked to users and leadership to figure out what a product should be.</p>

				                   
				                    <blockquote>We relied a lot on initial internal feedback to quickly adapt and iterate on interface design concepts.</blockquote>

				                    <p>I usually break up product design life cycle into four stages. The first being Definition, I think honestly a lot of time companies or project, especially in larger companies, don’t spend enough time in the Definition Step. They think they define it and quickly move on to the problem-solving ideation stage. But I think the key is to know first is to identify the correct problem worth solving, how we know it’s successful and what the metrics are for success.</p>


				                    <p>With this in mind, we then started exploring what the iD Card experience could look like. For this, I went on to see what examples could help us design a more usable iD Card and created different iterations of it. Won over the difficult stakeholders by designing detailed wireframes for every screen and states.</p>

				                    <blockquote>I think the key is to know first identify the correct problem worth solving, how we know it’s successful and what the metrics are for success.</blockquote>

				                    <p>Early wireframing and prototyping allowed us to quickly eliminate the concepts that didn’t feel good enough, and to validate/test the ones that had more potential. I know it is important when to sweat the details and when to get a rough version out for prototyping.</p>

				                    <p>We designed our minimum viable product and wanted to know how people would perceive ID Card and if they would know when or why do they need to verify their identity. We quickly identified that data ownership was a big concern which also tied in with security. What the interface had to provide was to make them feel secure and in control.  We created a “Verification” section which was more like a data vault, helping with more transparency around all their data all in one place.</p>

				                    <p>As we were focusing on our product, we got a chance to collaborate with New Zealand Govt. on a country wide concept on digital identities. New Zealand is one of the first countries to address the challenge of digital identity, starting with the launch of its government login service in 2007
 determine future needs regarding technology, user experience, agency integration, and privacy. The collaboration aim is to result in a clear and realistic vision for the next generation of digital identity services in New Zealand. Our commitment was to help brainstorm creating a secure, privacy-friendly digital ecosystem, building trust online through advanced identity solutions and privacy-centric practices.
Easy to use services and APIs that help people manage and protect their own identities, verify contacts, and build trusted teams at work.
This collaboration helped us to learn a lot about how identity verification is important on a country scale, what could be the use cases and what challenges are they facing to introduce it to the citizen</p>

				                    <p>As our lives become more digital, we're interacting with more people we've never met. We wanted to cater to this problem and allow companies and products to easily verify new members in their online community - so they and their users can build trust and confidence to interact more freely on their site.</p>

				                    <p>To achieve this goal we realized it is important to collaborate with companies, early stage startups in the sharing economy space to bring our vision of building an identity verification platform. We wanted to provide a great and simpler experience for the users as well as help companies to provide an industry-wide consistent verification standard and experience.</p>

				                    <p>Also in this space, sharing economy startups are focused on building great products and are great at it but they lack resource to build a verification platform, comply with legal standards and also prevent frauds from entering their community. Identity verification protects online marketplaces and communities by ensuring that the people signing up for the service are, in fact, who they say they are. It protects legitimate participants from potentially fraudulent ones</p>

				                    <p>Working towards this goal I figured out we need to create a very native and streamlined experience for verifying new members and also provide APIs and SDK to help developers to be able to easily integrate with us</p>

 									<h2 class="section-heading">So what about the process?</h2>

				                    <p>We started by exploring a lot of examples which involved a wizard like experience to complete tasks in different parallels. All the conversations always involved the Engg. team early on to collaborate and help along side the product team to understand some of the finer technical limitations as we dive into problem.  We knew security and trust will be a big concern as our product deals with handling personal and private individual data in order to verify it. The goal for us was to focus on <b>speed, simplicity and delight.</b></p>

				                    <p>The main question we were trying to answer was: How do you design an experience to optimize the workflow, to help users make the right decision without confusing them with too much information?
				                    </p>

				                    <p>Our aim was always to keep the solution simple and flexible. We started looking into OAuth as a possible candidate to authenticate the user securely and then verify their data. Companies like Google, Github and Facebook have implemented the experience and perfected the designs to cater to their use-cass pretty well. This would also help our users to transfer what they have experienced and learned from these popular user authentication systems.</p>

				                    <p>After a couple of initial Kickoff meetings with all the stakeholders and the product team in particular, I went on to create the initial task-based userflow. Once the team agreed upon the initial set of User Tasks, next was to device an easy and intuitive experience for users that would be initiated via a single button on our customer’s site to first authorize the user and then relay the relevant information to be verified. During this process one of the key part was to constantly pair up with the developers to understand certain complexities and constrains that could affect design and also help us create a quick MVP.</p>

				                    <p>One of the questions we always faced was what would be the behavior when someone clicks on “Verify Me” button. We looked into redirecting the users to identity.com sub domain, complete the steps and redirect them back. Another alternative was to open up a Pop-out window (e.g. Facebook Login) to do the verification step and would automatically dismiss once it's finished. The later experience also doesnt take the user away from what they were doing in the background and keep the context. Technically both were feasible, the Pop-out window was vital but challenging for the development team. Other approaches like Lightbox overlay were discarded due to security vulnerabilities.</p>

				                    <p>I came up with Initial wireframes for the verification steps, with multiple layout options to see what could work for us keeping in mind the experience should be adaptive for mobile. The goal was to create a  simple layout with scaffolded steps for users so they are focused on one task at a time and are not burdened by the no. of steps as it could defer depending on attributes to be verified. I decided to try out 2-column layouts as well as 1-column layout as a part of wireframe brainstorming.</p>
				                    <p>The design decision was to frame content that helped users stay in the context of the task, providing just enough data points (eg. breadcrumb indicators and contextual content help) in the foreground to help make an informed decision.</p>

				                    <p>The start of the experience should allow affordance for pre-existing Identity.com users to quickly verify and non-account holders to verify as a guest. So we created two buttons on that page.

									<p>Feedback from stakeholders was that the images on split layout were distracting and we wanted a very focused design approach. So the next step was to iterate the designs so that the main focus as a user is to complete the step and move on to the next one. Also removing images would increase load times aswell as make the design more adaptive to different screen-sizes. Here is the next design approach with a more one-column content layout. It was one of the alternatives we explored in the wireframe stage. </p>

				                    <p>We had soo many questions and so we curated a tasked based scenario to validate utility, usability and trust concerns regarding the flow.

Challenge was to mimic the prototype as the real product and also ask the right questions to bring out the cognitive affect states while users are interactive. The tests and interviews gave us lot of insights and critical product validation as well as some feedbacks which we wanted to cater to improve it for the next phase.

				                    <p>The most important piece of UX for a developer product isn't the homepage or the sign up process or the SDK download. It's the API documentation!

				                    <p>I started research on what are the best API documentation out there, talked with a lot of developers asking their favorite API products and documentation. What did they like about it? Why did they think it was easy and quick to integrate? How was the support and if the docs were updated?
This helped us to quickly understand what really matters for a developer and product team to consider integrating with us as a customer.</p>

				                    <p>I started work on the dashboard picking the brains of our business development team and potential customer’s need. This help to design certain parts of the Dashboard based on the inputs. Especially a section which tracked how many people attempted to verify themselves vs how many successfully verified (a very important stat from customer’s perspective). After numerous iterations, back and forth with the stakeholders, we decided on the final design for the Dashboard.</p>
