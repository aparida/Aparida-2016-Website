		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">Doing the persona was a really fun experience. One of the major hurdle was collaborating asynchronously before we could meet up in-person and discuss plan all our personas in one place. We started with a family tree in mind and used an app called Murally  (https://mural.ly/) and decided to do an interactive zoomable draggable persona chart. Keeping the Collective Inventions toolkit in mind we laid all the 6 members in our family on the digital board. Then we discussed the age, birth year and profession. The emphasis here was to cover all the age groups and people from different eras. This would give us flexibility and more coverage to describe our future scenarios. We used the online platform Murally effectively to collaborate add images and sticky notes to each of the personas. Then we added the links and detailed description one by one. The best part was to refer our observations, interviews take signs, hints and help from the present era to make personas of the future. I personally loved the way we went about thinking the scenario and debating would the characters really do this or would that exist in 2050. Things had to be made believable and yet creative enough. Choosing Father as a nature inspired interface designer and mother as a teacher and education technologist. Strategically mother belongs to Singapore and it being a inter cultural marriage. Small details like Grandmother and Daughter in law have yoga as their common interest and they enjoy doing it together. I think this exercise really made me think and visualize the Pittsburgh 3.0 in a very different way.  A major part of making it a smooth collaborative effort also goes to the digital platform we used.

						<h2><span class="lines">THE IDEATE Architecture</span></h2>
					
						<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">21st Century University Architecture emphasizing on equal distribution of entropy and natural distribution. Last week Thanassis presentation on the Ideate program and his ideology was really impressive. I love the way he went about thinking, comparing and analyzing his concepts with the real world. The one thing which was evident was the emphasis on using mathematical concept like that of Normal distribution and entropy for describing and solving of the 21st century University Activities.  Giving interdisciplinary courses more importance seems really the way to look forward. Thanassis also mentioned that importance to be given on integrating design and problem solving eg. Sustainability, where one discipline is not enough and we need a wider broad skill know how to collaborate and solve the problem, going beyond individual components. I liked the point that more focus should be on the problem in hand and not jumping on to the solution, which is also really talked about in our DTF class by Arnold to always pursue those questions and not think about solutions. It is important to design for architecture than to design for solutions. I went about analyzing my program and choice of courses and check if I have a normal distribution of courses. I took courses from Computer Science/Learning Science, one form Psychology Department and one from School of Design. I think this should be a good mix and fall somewhat under that principle Thanassis talked about. Indeed my decision of taking the above courses has a threshold level of Skills with baseline expertise in certain field and refine improve and amplify. </p>

		  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">Looking at this video, I got really impressed but later reflected on the good and the bad part of this vision. Ofcourse this looks very compelling at first. Surrounded by intelligent systems doing the mundane taks for you, but are they really making our tasks easy or are they adding a lot of cognitive load to our brain on figuring how to operate these ? I saw the interactions and tried to compare with what we are doing today with interfaces. Although the visual design looks modern less complex quick to understand but when it comes to interacting with them, it really looks artificial and not logical. Perhaps when we advance to the future the metacognition will drive us to build a knowledge of using complex systems. Also an important thing I noticed that this video showcases is aged people are comfotable using modern gadgets and embrace it unlike now.</p>

						<h2><span class="lines">Lifeworthy Learning reflection</span></h2>
					
						<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">This reflection is specifically on more in-depth thoughts on the LearnPgh 2050 project and I started thinking why we want
	 to learn on the first hand, which will drive future learning scenarios. So I sat down and started thinking, plotting and asking myself a question " What is worth learning?" and how can we make it a "Lifeworthy Learning" experience. I started searching more on life worthy learning and whats going on currently around the world. In the future a baseline will always hold true that "Learning will matter in the lives learners are going to live". This applies to any circumstances the future shapes into. But learning objectives will be reflecting the learners lives. The focus will be from hierarchy to network learning, but we also need to filter the learnings that doesn't matter. Emphasis and looking beyond towards the future of learning, I stumbled upon the Future of Learning Institute (called ProjectZero) by David Perkins in the Harvard Graduate school of Education. Some of the thoughts and their focus resonated with mine, and the concept of Six Beyonds. Education and learning is beyond local spheres and it needs a global perspective. One should look at beyond topics and contents as tools for thinking and actions. . Beyond Traditional Disciplines of STEM but renewed and extended vision for new disciplines. I think in the future the eagerness to learn new skills according to the learners living style would create opportunities for new disciples to come up. Also the importance of going beyond discrete disciplines but towards a more interdisciplinary topics. One can find the weak signals for them now as we try to incorporate and teach introduce more interdisciplinary culture, but in the future it is going to drive more innovation and thinking. Going beyond the prescribed studies and learners choose why they want to learn making their curricula more personalized. This is more so evident at this stage with the help of internet and other media channels , personalized learning and access of various materials via youtube, online courses and skill sharing platforms. As we also emphasized in our project presentation, even though computers and droid would be intelligent enough to do certain tedious tasks, but still certain skills involving creativity and competences are crucial in the future. Therefore, I think for lifeworthy learning these principles would stand tall even more so in the future. The insights give a clear picture when we see the changes in learning behavior, content and resources. Weak signs for collaboration towards information and expertise is already visible. We are on a process to reimagining education for an expanding universe of learning. </p>

		  				<h2><span class="lines">Phonebloks: Phone worth keeping</span></h2>
		  			
		  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">A phone only lasts a couple of years before it breaks or becomes obsolete. Although it's often just one part which killed it, we throw everything away since it's almost impossible to repair or upgrade.</p>
		  				
		  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">So <strong>Phonebloks</strong> solves this problem as it is <strong>made of detachable bloks</strong>. The bloks are connected to the base which locks everything together into a solid phone. If a blok breaks you can easily replace it, if it's getting old just upgrade bloks.</p>
		  				
		  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">Phonebloks solution of blocks based components makes it sustainable and more usable product. This concept can be used to any other forms of devices not only to phones. In this solution there is a good case study on the <strong>insight</strong> where currently 70% of the waste electronics are in working condition and one component or a part is malfunctioning. The manufacturers also either encourage to upgrade the product and not replace hence the design doesnt allow block level upgrades of electronic goods.  It also explores laterally <strong>(farsight) </strong>and tries to get inspirtation from nature on how it handles misfits or disfunctioning parts. The root cause of the problem is cured by replacing or repairing that particular part and the rest of the system remain intact and efficient.</p>
		  				
		  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">The Phoneblok project understands that people want this change and they are moving towrds making this concept a reality this is where I see the <strong>foresight</strong> view of the project. In future, mobile being such a critical aspect of human life currently, this solution will trickle down to other domains and create more sustainable ideas.</p>
		  				
		  				
		  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">While talking about <strong>epistemology</strong> the <strong>context</strong> for this project is at the core fundamental principles running the planet. More focus on marketing and sale strategy is overlooking solutions which can be really innovate and sustainable. The  <strong>impact</strong> something like this could be both creative customizable, a reform in thinking and give users more power on what exactly they want with their phones and portable devices.</p>

I happen to discover  a great 3D online building tool which might we used to convey our ideas visually.  Played around with it for a couple of hours and making prototype designs are fast and quick. Perhaps useful in areas like mobility, housing and learning forms visualization.</p>

						<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">I would like to state some points which I feel are really highlighted in the article. The country looks so much better from the bottom up — from its major metropolitan areas — than from the top down. So the great laboratories and engines of our economy are now our cities. Cities are focusing on creating networks that combine skilled laborers and knowledge workers, with universities and technical schools, quality infrastructure and high-speed Internet. Cities “doing the hard work of growing our new economy,” One bad example in the article was on Detroit- Storm of municipal mismanagement, auto company mismanagement, major job decentralization and property abandonment.</p>
