		  				<h2><span class="lines">DxTF Process Reflection</span></h2>
		  				
		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">
		  				Dexign the future has been a great experience and a very challenging at the same time. Lot of learning and brainstorming opportunities for me compared to all other courses. Personally it has been a phase to combine all my learnings from other courses taking design from abstract to a vision. I think the course started with our declarative knowledge and perception of the future but gradually moved into a procedural knowledge phase where major emphasis and segmenting was done to embrace the process involved in designing the future scenarios.  </p>
		  				
		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">
		  				The team and its composition was a major factor for maintaining the motivation. The collaboration and solutions provided by each member at critical moments helped to sustain effort over time. We tried to plan the work well in advance, divide it accurately to members who are interested in taking their part. We stuck with each members' strength and skill to get the tasks done. Also async collaboration played a major part and this is where we strategically used the online tools to collaborate. We used various online tools to plan and strategize as well as implement our project. Google Docs, mural.ly , Invisionapp and dropbox share were the tools we relied on for our collaboration. </p>
		  				
		  				
		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">
		  				Scaffolding of the whole course into milestones with explicit deliverables enabled me to focus on the right things, not overshoot requirements or get overwhelmed by  the end product being asked. Monitoring performance was difficult but weekly separate team discussion with Arnold and Peter helped tremendously to gauge the progress and expectation. I think as per following the process we team pedagogy felt very encouraged by the response from the faculty advices and also utilized all the strategies recommended from creating benchmarks to developing persona scenarios. I think some battles which I faced was answering the most important but fundamental question to myself again and again "what learning means to a human? ", getting to an answer was not the goal but understanding the question was.</p>

		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">
		  				I felt very pleased and motivated when the team decided to work on Learning in 2050. It was in sync with my focus on Learning Science and also very much a challenging project to design for. The intense discussion as a whole class was very useful to get different perspective and input. Looking at other projects made me personally think of ways we could implement our own or measure our performance and strategies against them. I would also like to mention the Field Trips to CreateLab was pleasing and thereafter the expeditionary Treks were really helpful as a learning experience. </p>

		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">
		  				One of the stronghold of this course for me has always been Arnold's influence and guidance. The vast experience and knowledge helped and kept us motivated in each step of this course, specially the reflections from Arnold on his blog and dxtf site. Writing our own reflections was a great way for me to express my ideas, observations and thoughts. Its not something I did in the past, but now I think I will be carrying this habit forward with more reflections and observations of designs I encounter in the future. Reading peer reflections on their blogs was truly grasping, a great way to get more in less time. </p>

		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">
		  				I think my future path will be so influenced by this course and the knowledge I have grasped as well as the team collaboration and process applied. I hope in the distant future I would definitely reflect back on this Fall 2013 and smile on the scenarios designed which came true.

		  				Data vizualization has always been fascinating for me due to the way data and its concept is illustrated.Above is an animated vizualization of future decentralized currency: Bitcoin. With the economy worldwide a major concern this new concept of decentralized online currency could really transform possibilities in the future where learning , sharing and opportunity can take massive advantage of this infrastucture. I have already started mining and collection my Bitcoins and I guess becoming an early adoptor will lead and help the society to transform how currency is viewed globally.

		  				<h2><span class="lines">vision for learning spaces in 2050</span></h2>
		  				
		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">During the thanksgiving break I was looking for more inspiring visions for the future. And I thought how many others would be solving similar problems which we were doing in the Dexign the Future class. Actually I found other visions for learning spaces in 2050. It has been a vital part for our Learning in 2050 Project. Here some really nice ideas are portrayed and some are very similar to the ones dexigned by our team. It clearly shows the emphasis on spaces and its effectiveness on learning to show farsight vision. It showcases learners engaged in personlized task, hybrid learning spaces along with digital courses. Also it depicts thats Physical learning spaces will be there only for the wealthiest and needy learners in the future. Face to face learning will still prevail at the elementary level among children learning fundamental skills. More focus on seating comfort and group peer learning spaces. The video also talks about mobile furnitures and spaces which adjust do various learning spaces and requirements. Some interesting points are mentioned where learners gain knowledge via simulation and educational games and then their performance in these could then be converted into credits. They also introduce the concept of a Learning hub very similar to our Team Pedagogy's vision which is open light and desk free acting as a hub for community learning. Altough I wonder if these visions were made considering some insights from the current weak forces.</p>

							<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">

	This is a new fantastic advancement in 3D printing where one can now print an entire 2500sqft house in 20 Hours and many other complex structures efficiently. It is done via a process called CAD/CAM (computer-aided design / computer-aided manufacturing). 3D models are designed on a computer and then manufactured using CNC Machines or 3D printers.  It is  manufactured into a physical object automatically, with instruction from 3D computer model to physical object without human interface. The size of the 3D printer is large enough to construct walls by depositing concrete based material layer upon layer to build a wall. This has really fascinated me with the possibilities it portrays for the future of manufacturing. </p>

						<h2><span class="lines">The Big Question : IS A SMART PHONE APP THE FUTURE OF EVERYTHING?</span></h2>
					
						<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">

The video post <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=r13uYs7jglg">http://www.youtube.com/watch_popup?v=r13uYs7jglg</a> got me thinking a lot on how smart devices are playing a crucial role in future technologies and interactions. One can find ubiquitous embedded system in many new innovative products. The use of hand held affordable smart mobile devices has shown promise for a vast change in the domain of healthcare and fitness. Be it for measuring heart pulse or ultrasound, realtime face-face and affordable methods is making it easier to monitor check and plan your health care. Even ubiquitous embedded devices like in the field of fitness has gained of a lot of popularity and has become a common personal add-on device. It is critical to acknowledge to role of these smart devices in the coming times. I feel the smartphones are still dumb as they could do much more with the technology but still are constrained. A smartphone is the best possible personal device which is a window to know a person's routine, sleep cycles, travel movements, friends, intentional behavior, demographics and also other forms of data which can be wisely used to make it even more personal and intelligent experience. The apps are certainly getting there but I think it is only with the mix of the right hardware and software which is going to be the future. This Robot-Human Interaction is going to happen in a way where the smart robots learn more about us and try to give us experiences and timely remedial suggestions. Certainly apps in this field are already changing the scene with apps giving real tangible incentives for us to be motivated to perform certain tasks. I would love to see the pathway ubiquitous embedded learning takes in the future.</p>

					<h2><span class="lines">Promising Principles in Education and Learning</span></h2>
				
					<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">I was going through some Charter schools and get to know more about the system and principles of education applied there. I got to know about Propel Schools and the promising principles in education for the future years. It was really interesting to realize the principles are soo aligned with the learning2050 benchmark and pathways.  The six princples that Propel schools are sturctured around are named below. < strong>Agile instructions:</strong> Each learner has distinct and changing needs. Teachers and teacher teams continually and flexibly adjust instruction to meet learner needs. <strong>Embedded Support</strong> Everyone in the organization is guided, nurtured, and encouraged. Everyone is a coach & mentor. Everyone is coached. <strong>Culture of Dignity: </strong>Relationships, built upon a fundamental appreciation for the unique experiences of each individual both in school and beyond. <strong>Fully Valued Arts Program: </strong> Artistic expression and creativity are essential components of a complete education. <strong>Vibrant Communities</strong>Continuous professional learning and growth are both expected and supported. <strong>Quest for Excellence</strong>: Good is never enough.  Administrators, faculty, and staff are constantly striving to reach an
ever-rising standard of excellence.</p>

					<h2><span class="lines">ALIGNMENT OF THE THREE PATHWAYS</span></h2>
				
					<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">As we are halfway through in our projects, it was interesting to see the interconnection of pathways of each of these projects as a Big Picture. I got more interested as it resurfaced from our initital discussion on his point early in the course. Alignment of LEARN SHARE and OPPORTUNITY  2050 is very critical and enables it to become a super force for change.  The way Silicon Valley's Knowledge Ecosystem has evovled is a clear sign of the proper alignment and has become a unitary, practice-based, account of both internal and the external flows of organizational knowledge. I have seen similar signs in other cities around the world which are starting to be hubs for small smartups such as Berling or Bangalore. These cities although new to the scene have a common mix of ingredients in form of LEARN , SHARE and OPPORTUNITY. The alignment of these three parthways is not only limited to cities or organizations, rather it is also applicable to products where learning from research, sharing the results with other like minded people and creating commercial opportunities from it has become a big success. It can be seen even in future design products like  <a href="http://www.airstream.com/live-riveted/">Air Stream trailer</a> or something intangible such as "BIG DATA" and "THE INTERNET OF THINGS". It all starts with alignment of the three prime pathways towards a global futuristc vision.</p>

		  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px"> This is the world's first 3D sensor for mobile devices. The Structure Sensor gives mobile devices the ability to capture scan and understand the world in three dimensions. When I saw this, I was totally blown away with the ways it can be used and the future signs and weak signals it demonstate. The possibility of scanning an object in 3D space and then LEARN from it, thereafter SHARE it with others on the fly makes it soo powerful. Also the fact that it bridges the gap between a 2D screen mobile devices to convert and display any 3D object infront of it just by scanning. Scan objects and rooms in 3D, play augmented reality games, and develop mobile apps with 3D vision these endless OPPORTUNITY it potrays is phenominal. </p>

	  				<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">Doing the persona was a really fun experience. One of the major hurdle was collaborating asynchronously before we could meet up in-person and discuss plan all our personas in one place. We started with a family tree in mind and used an app called Murally  (https://mural.ly/) and decided to do an interactive zoomable draggable persona chart. Keeping the Collective Inventions toolkit in mind we laid all the 6 members in our family on the digital board. Then we discussed the age, birth year and profession. The emphasis here was to cover all the age groups and people from different eras. This would give us flexibility and more coverage to describe our future scenarios. We used the online platform Murally effectively to collaborate add images and sticky notes to each of the personas. Then we added the links and detailed description one by one. The best part was to refer our observations, interviews take signs, hints and help from the present era to make personas of the future. I personally loved the way we went about thinking the scenario and debating would the characters really do this or would that exist in 2050. Things had to be made believable and yet creative enough. Choosing Father as a nature inspired interface designer and mother as a teacher and education technologist. Strategically mother belongs to Singapore and it being a inter cultural marriage. Small details like Grandmother and Daughter in law have yoga as their common interest and they enjoy doing it together. I think this exercise really made me think and visualize the Pittsburgh 3.0 in a very different way.  A major part of making it a smooth collaborative effort also goes to the digital platform we used.

					<h2><span class="lines">THE IDEATE Architecture</span></h2>
				
					<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">21st Century University Architecture emphasizing on equal distribution of entropy and natural distribution. Last week Thanassis presentation on the Ideate program and his ideology was really impressive. I love the way he went about thinking, comparing and analyzing his concepts with the real world. The one thing which was evident was the emphasis on using mathematical concept like that of Normal distribution and entropy for describing and solving of the 21st century University Activities.  Giving interdisciplinary courses more importance seems really the way to look forward. Thanassis also mentioned that importance to be given on integrating design and problem solving eg. Sustainability, where one discipline is not enough and we need a wider broad skill know how to collaborate and solve the problem, going beyond individual components. I liked the point that more focus should be on the problem in hand and not jumping on to the solution, which is also really talked about in our DTF class by Arnold to always pursue those questions and not think about solutions. It is important to design for architecture than to design for solutions. I went about analyzing my program and choice of courses and check if I have a normal distribution of courses. I took courses from Computer Science/Learning Science, one form Psychology Department and one from School of Design. I think this should be a good mix and fall somewhat under that principle Thanassis talked about. Indeed my decision of taking the above courses has a threshold level of Skills with baseline expertise in certain field and refine improve and amplify. </p>

	  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">Looking at this video, I got really impressed but later reflected on the good and the bad part of this vision. Ofcourse this looks very compelling at first. Surrounded by intelligent systems doing the mundane taks for you, but are they really making our tasks easy or are they adding a lot of cognitive load to our brain on figuring how to operate these ? I saw the interactions and tried to compare with what we are doing today with interfaces. Although the visual design looks modern less complex quick to understand but when it comes to interacting with them, it really looks artificial and not logical. Perhaps when we advance to the future the metacognition will drive us to build a knowledge of using complex systems. Also an important thing I noticed that this video showcases is aged people are comfotable using modern gadgets and embrace it unlike now.</p>

					<h2><span class="lines">Lifeworthy Learning reflection</span></h2>
				
					<p class="availability" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">This reflection is specifically on more in-depth thoughts on the LearnPgh 2050 project and I started thinking why we want
 to learn on the first hand, which will drive future learning scenarios. So I sat down and started thinking, plotting and asking myself a question " What is worth learning?" and how can we make it a "Lifeworthy Learning" experience. I started searching more on life worthy learning and whats going on currently around the world. In the future a baseline will always hold true that "Learning will matter in the lives learners are going to live". This applies to any circumstances the future shapes into. But learning objectives will be reflecting the learners lives. The focus will be from hierarchy to network learning, but we also need to filter the learnings that doesn't matter. Emphasis and looking beyond towards the future of learning, I stumbled upon the Future of Learning Institute (called ProjectZero) by David Perkins in the Harvard Graduate school of Education. Some of the thoughts and their focus resonated with mine, and the concept of Six Beyonds. Education and learning is beyond local spheres and it needs a global perspective. One should look at beyond topics and contents as tools for thinking and actions. . Beyond Traditional Disciplines of STEM but renewed and extended vision for new disciplines. I think in the future the eagerness to learn new skills according to the learners living style would create opportunities for new disciples to come up. Also the importance of going beyond discrete disciplines but towards a more interdisciplinary topics. One can find the weak signals for them now as we try to incorporate and teach introduce more interdisciplinary culture, but in the future it is going to drive more innovation and thinking. Going beyond the prescribed studies and learners choose why they want to learn making their curricula more personalized. This is more so evident at this stage with the help of internet and other media channels , personalized learning and access of various materials via youtube, online courses and skill sharing platforms. As we also emphasized in our project presentation, even though computers and droid would be intelligent enough to do certain tedious tasks, but still certain skills involving creativity and competences are crucial in the future. Therefore, I think for lifeworthy learning these principles would stand tall even more so in the future. The insights give a clear picture when we see the changes in learning behavior, content and resources. Weak signs for collaboration towards information and expertise is already visible. We are on a process to reimagining education for an expanding universe of learning. </p>

	  				<h2><span class="lines">Phonebloks: Phone worth keeping</span></h2>
	  			
	  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">A phone only lasts a couple of years before it breaks or becomes obsolete. Although it's often just one part which killed it, we throw everything away since it's almost impossible to repair or upgrade.</p>
	  				
	  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">So <strong>Phonebloks</strong> solves this problem as it is <strong>made of detachable bloks</strong>. The bloks are connected to the base which locks everything together into a solid phone. If a blok breaks you can easily replace it, if it's getting old just upgrade bloks.</p>
	  				
	  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">Phonebloks solution of blocks based components makes it sustainable and more usable product. This concept can be used to any other forms of devices not only to phones. In this solution there is a good case study on the <strong>insight</strong> where currently 70% of the waste electronics are in working condition and one component or a part is malfunctioning. The manufacturers also either encourage to upgrade the product and not replace hence the design doesnt allow block level upgrades of electronic goods.  It also explores laterally <strong>(farsight) </strong>and tries to get inspirtation from nature on how it handles misfits or disfunctioning parts. The root cause of the problem is cured by replacing or repairing that particular part and the rest of the system remain intact and efficient.</p>
	  				
	  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">The Phoneblok project understands that people want this change and they are moving towrds making this concept a reality this is where I see the <strong>foresight</strong> view of the project. In future, mobile being such a critical aspect of human life currently, this solution will trickle down to other domains and create more sustainable ideas.</p>
	  				
	  				
	  				<p class="availability1" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:20px">While talking about <strong>epistemology</strong> the <strong>context</strong> for this project is at the core fundamental principles running the planet. More focus on marketing and sale strategy is overlooking solutions which can be really innovate and sustainable. The  <strong>impact</strong> something like this could be both creative customizable, a reform in thinking and give users more power on what exactly they want with their phones and portable devices.</p>

The country looks so much better from the bottom up — from its major metropolitan areas — than from the top down. So the great laboratories and engines of our economy are now our cities. Cities are focusing on creating networks that combine skilled laborers and knowledge workers, with universities and technical schools, quality infrastructure and high-speed Internet. Cities “doing the hard work of growing our new economy,” One bad example in the article was on Detroit- Storm of municipal mismanagement, auto company mismanagement, major job decentralization and property abandonment.</p>
